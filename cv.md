## Summary:
 I'm a self-taught Front-end developer. I have been learning frontend for about 10 months. I'm passionate about tech and AI. I consider myself as an extremelly hardworking, responsible, persistent and goal-oriented person.

  My goal is to become a full-stack developer. In the near future apart from Js I plan to learn Python and Java. I'm a life-time learner. I never give up when it comes to achieving my goals.

 I'm very fluent in English and don't have any slavic accent. I can also speak and write some Chinese Mandarin.

My most favorite school subjects were Math, chemistry, languages, literature, physics. In addition, I studied at music school. I won lots of  school competitions in the field of music, math, chemistry, languages.

It's my natural ability and talent to quickly learn languages and other things so I guess I can successfully apply it in programming.
